## Update Your System

Before making any customizations, it's essential to update your system to ensure you have the latest security patches, bug fixes, and software updates. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

This will fetch and install all available updates, keeping your system stable and secure. Once the update is complete, reboot your system to apply the changes:

```bash
reboot
```

Now, you're ready to proceed with further optimizations and customizations! ðŸš€
