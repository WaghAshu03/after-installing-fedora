# Installing Multimedia Codecs

## Switch to full ffmpeg

Fedora ffmpeg-free works most of the time, but one will experience version missmatch from time to time. Switch to the rpmfusion provided ffmpeg build that is better supported. You will still need to follow the next section for additional codecs or plugins related to packages you might have installed.

```bash
sudo dnf swap ffmpeg-free ffmpeg --allowerasing
```

There you don't need libavcodec-freeworld that is only meant to complement the ffmpeg-free package (and related libraries).

## Install additional codec

This will allows the application using the gstreamer framework and other multimedia software, to play others restricted codecs:

- The following command will install the complements multimedia packages needed by gstreamer enabled applications:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf update @multimedia --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin
  ```

## Hardware Accelerated Codec

### Intel(recent)

\# Using the rpmfusion-nonfree section

```bash
sudo dnf install intel-media-driver
```

### Intel(older)

\# Using the rpmfusion-free section

```bash
sudo dnf install libva-intel-driver
```

### Hardware codecs with AMD (mesa)

\# Using the rpmfusion-free section This is needed since Fedora 37 and later... and mainly concern AMD hardware since NVIDIA hardware with nouveau doesn't work well

```bash
sudo dnf swap mesa-va-drivers mesa-va-drivers-freeworld
sudo dnf swap mesa-vdpau-drivers mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld
```

If using i686 compat libraries (for steam or alikes):

```bash
sudo dnf swap mesa-va-drivers.i686 mesa-va-drivers-freeworld.i686
sudo dnf swap mesa-vdpau-drivers.i686 mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld.i686
```

### Hardware codecs with NVIDIA

The Nvidia proprietary driver doesn't support VAAPI natively, but there is a wrapper that can bridge NVDEC/NVENC with VAAPI

```bash
sudo dnf install libva-nvidia-driver
```

You can also install both 32bit and 64bit flavor in one command as needed.

```bash
sudo dnf install libva-nvidia-driver.{i686,x86_64}
```

## Various firmwares

- Tainted nonfree is dedicated to non-FLOSS packages without a clear redistribution status by the copyright holder. But is allowed as part of hardware inter-operability between operating systems in some countries :

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install rpmfusion-nonfree-release-tainted
  sudo dnf --repo=rpmfusion-nonfree-tainted install "\*-firmware"
  ```

## Some More Codecs

- Run the following commands to install multimedia codecs in your Fedora system:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-*,good-*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude=gstreamer1-
  sudo dnf install lame* --exclude=lame-devel
  sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia
  sudo dnf install x265-libs libde265
  ```

- Then install all codes and drivers from softwares:
