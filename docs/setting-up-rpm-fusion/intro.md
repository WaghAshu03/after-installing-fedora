# Intro to RPM Fusion

**RPM Fusion** is a third-party repository that provides additional software for Fedora that isn't included in the official repositories due to licensing, patent, or legal reasons. It offers a wide range of packages, including multimedia codecs, proprietary drivers (like NVIDIA), and various applications that enhance the Fedora experience.

RPM Fusion is divided into two repositories:

- Free â€“ Open-source software that complies with Fedoraâ€™s licensing guidelines.
- Nonfree â€“ Software that is closed-source or has redistribution restrictions (e.g., proprietary drivers).

By enabling RPM Fusion, you gain access to essential tools and software that make Fedora more versatile and user-friendly. ðŸš€
